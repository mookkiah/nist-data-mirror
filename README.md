# NIST Data Mirror

A simple Java command-line utility to mirror the NVD (CPE/CVE JSON) data from NIST.

The intended purpose of nist-data-mirror is to be able to replicate the NIST vulnerabiity data
inside a company firewall so that local (faster) access to NIST data can be achieved.

nist-data-mirror does not rely on any third-party dependencies, only the Java SE core libraries.
It can be used in combination with [OWASP Dependency-Check] in order to provide Dependency-Check
a mirrored copy of NIST data.

For best results, use nist-data-mirror with cron or another scheduler to keep the mirrored data fresh.

## Usage

### Building

```sh
mvn clean package
```

### Running

```sh
java -jar nist-data-mirror.jar <mirror-directory>
```

To use a proxy provide http.proxyHost / http.proxyPort system properties.

## Downloading

If you do not wish to download sources and compile yourself, [pre-compiled binaries] are available
for use. NIST Data Mirror is also available on the Maven Central Repository.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>us.springett</groupId>
    <artifactId>nist-data-mirror</artifactId>
    <version>1.5.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Docker

A Dockerfile is included, and the image is available on Docker Hub as [sspringett/nvdmirror](https://hub.docker.com/r/sspringett/nvdmirror). This was created to
assist in debugging other issues. While the image does create an httpd instance
that mirrors the NVD CVE data feeds - note that it also creates a backup for all
changed files and there is currently no automatic cleanup.

```
$ mvn clean package
$ docker build --rm -t sspringett/nvdmirror .
$ mkdir target/docs
$ docker run -dit \
  --name mirror \
  -p 80:80 \
  --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/target/docs/,target=/usr/local/apache2/htdocs \
  sspringett/nvdmirror
```

The httpd server will take a minute to spin up as it is mirroring the initial NVD files.

To use a proxy during build time provide the `http_proxy`, `https_proxy` and `no_proxy`
environment variables as build arguments (e.g. `--build-arg http_proxy="${http_proxy}"`.
For the runtime you can pass the `http.proxyHost` and `http.proxyPort` values in `_JAVA_OPTIONS`.

For example.

```
_JAVA_OPTIONS="-Dhttps.proxyHost=yourproxyhost.domain -Dhttps.proxyPort=3128 -Dhttp.proxyHost=yourproxyhost.domain
      -Dhttp.proxyPort=3128 -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts="localhost|*.domain"
```

The image is designed to be executed as a random non-root user and can be deployed on
container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes and OpenShift.
